# Feature development workflow

When the user asks to **add a feature**, **implement an issue**, or **develop from GitHub/requirements**:

1. **Delegate to the Feature Development Agent**  
   Invoke the `feature-dev-agent` subagent so it can run the full flow: obtain requirements → acceptance criteria → implement → test → commit/push.

2. **Requirements source**
   - Prefer programmatic: run `scripts/fetch-requirements.js` with `GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_ISSUE` (and `GITHUB_TOKEN` if needed).
   - Otherwise use REQUIREMENTS.md, issue body, or user-provided acceptance criteria.

3. **Do not skip verification**  
   Always run the project test script after implementation and fix any failures before suggesting commit.

4. **Commit and push**  
   Suggest a clear commit message and remind about `git push`; only run git commands if the user has confirmed.
