# Testing agents

When the user asks to **add tests**, **write tests**, or **run tests**, delegate to the appropriate testing agent:

| User intent | Agent |
|-------------|--------|
| Unit tests, test coverage, testing a function/module | `unit-test-agent` |
| UI tests, E2E, browser tests, testing a page or flow | `ui-test-agent` |
| API tests, HTTP/REST tests, testing endpoints | `api-test-agent` |

- If the user says "unit tests" or "test this function" → use **unit-test-agent**.
- If the user says "UI tests", "E2E", or "test in browser" → use **ui-test-agent**.
- If the user says "API tests" or "test this endpoint" → use **api-test-agent**.
- If unclear, ask or pick the agent that best matches the code under test (module vs page vs API).

After feature work, the Feature Development Agent already runs the project test script; use these agents when the user explicitly wants to add or improve unit, UI, or API tests.
