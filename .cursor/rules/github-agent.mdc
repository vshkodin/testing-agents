# GitHub agent

When the user asks about **GitHub**, an **issue**, a **PR**, **commit message**, **branch name**, or **fetching requirements from GitHub**:

- Delegate to the **github-agent** so it can:
  - Fetch issue or requirements (e.g. run `scripts/fetch-requirements.js` with GITHUB_REPO, GITHUB_ISSUE, GITHUB_TOKEN).
  - Propose a commit message from staged or recent changes.
  - Draft a PR description or suggest a branch name.
  - Summarize issue/PR context.

For **implementing** a feature from an issue, the feature-dev-agent already uses the fetch script; use github-agent when the user only wants to fetch/summarize issue data, get a commit message, or prepare a PR—not full implementation.

Never put GITHUB_TOKEN or secrets in prompts or committed files; use env vars only.
